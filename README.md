## Inspiration and perspective behind building the Poster Generator cusotom block

Advertising, both print and digital account for 54.39 billion dollars of market when clubbed together [Goldstein Report](<https://www.goldsteinresearch.com/report/india-advertising-market#:~:text=Goldstein%20Research%20analyst%20forecast%20that,period%20(2017%2D2025).>). According to this [report](https://themanifest.com/advertising/small-business-advertising-spending-2019) from the manifest, nearly all small businesses (91%) plan to increase their advertising spending, indicating that small businesses prioritize advertising and see it as a beneficial marketing strategy.

I lead a developer community and although I am not a marketeer, after some discussion with friends in the space I found out that when it came to building assets(posters to be more specific) marketing managers and event managers have exactly the same needs:

1. A **RAPID** poster building/prototyping tool that is really easy to edit.
2. Shouldn't require design experience.
3. Poster should showcase my/client's brand well without much editing effort.
4. Something strictly within Airtable to avoid platform switches and all the friction that comes along.
5. Customizable/draggable text.
6. Downloadable outside airtable as well.

I realized this is a great market fit and it uncovered a need for a small to medium business (for quick execution and generating posters for campaigning) and also for a large organization with a dedicated design team (for rapid prototyping inside airtable) and started on towards my journey of building the **poster generator custom block** over an airtable base in my workspace.

Please note that blocks are still in beta and are accessibe in Pro and Enterprise workspaces for now.

To support planning and managing of these advertising campaigns, airtable already has a base template which can be accessed [here](https://airtable.com/templates/marketing/expNoL0sYUbOogSCm/advertising-campaigns) which I think is the best suited place to install and experience the block.
